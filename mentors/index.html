        </div>
            <p>We know you guys like bullet points, so here they are:</p>

            <p>YRS happens in centres across the UK &#8212; a centre is a business that has space and wifi to take up to 10 kids</p>

            <ul>
                <li>we assign kids from central sign up as well as local recruiting (by centres)</li>

                <li>we ensure that each centre has at least one mentor for the Monday ‚ü∂  Thursday</li>

                <li>we are trying to assign one alumnus per centre this year as well (but that might not be possible)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mentors will:</h3>

            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Q: Will mentors get Tee Shirts?</strong><br />
                A: Yes.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Will travel and subsistence be covered for mentors?</strong><br />
                A: Sorry, no.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Do mentors need to be available every day of the week 6 &rarr; 12<sup>th</sup> August?</strong><br />
                A: Not at all, we will be in touch and will work out which days you are free. But <em>be warned</em>, it is very addictive and compelling and you will want to be there, especially at the end!</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Can I chat to a mentor who has done it before?</strong><br />
                A: Yes, we plan to ask a few mentors from previous years to be available for queries. In the first instance please contact <a href="mailto:dave@bowsy.co.uk">David Durant</a>.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Do I need to be CRB checked?</strong><br />
                A: No but there will be no 1-2-1 mentoring, everything will happen in a single open space (this will be the centres to sort). We are looking into the rules for the festival at the end of the week. So watch this space.</li>

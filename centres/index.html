            <p>YRS centres are organisations across the UK who have space to host at least three young people. Ideally you would have some developers in-house, but we will send mentors and/or alumni for the week.

	    <br /><br />

            You will need to have wifi (very important) and have one person from your organisation as the main point of contact and available that week 6-11th August.

	    <br/><br />

            We are signing young people up centrally who hear about this through the media but we also would expect you to recruit locally. (We support you in these efforts, but it is of great benefit to you to build those relationships with your local coding youth!).

	    <br /><br />

            We assign young people to centres from Easter holidays through to August, and where we have centres and no young people we make every effort to help you recruit locally and where we have young people and no centres, we seek out centres &#8212; it is quite simple really!</p>

	    <h3>How will the week work?</h3>

            <p>The idea is that the young developers come in on the Monday morning and have a brainstorming session with your developers and our <a href="/mentors/">mentors</a>/alumni who will be with you.

	    <br /><br />

            They look at the data on <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a> (or other open data we send/detail to you) and choose either a data set they want to play with, or a theme/issue they want to tackle using a variety of open data sets. (We like them to use data from at least one data.gov.uk set, it can be mashed with as many other open data sets (or your own) as they like).

	    <br /><br />

            They begin to build an idea and can work on this in a group or individually. By the second day, they need to start coding. They will then spend the rest of the week developing their idea and creating it. This will be very lively and communication between centres and mentors over twitter and email is key here &#8212; we will keep on top of this.

	    <br /><br />

            On the Friday every centre needs to gather their young coders up and bring them all to <a href="http://tnmoc.org/">The National Museum of Computing</a>, <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org/">Bletchley Park</a> for the festival of code. They will continue coding, hear lightning talks from interesting people, play on BBC Micros and sleep in tents readying themselves for a big show and tell on the Saturday to a mixture of Government, Press and Industry. There will be music. We will co-ordinate this migration with you and yes, it will include getting them home too &#8212; but we will help you, don't worry.</p>

	    <h3>Money</h3>

            <p>This event is free for young people to attend, but we are raising sponsorship money for necessities for the festival and a hardship fund for travel through <a href="http://www.peoplefund.it/young-rewired-state/">PeopleFund.it</a> as well as private donors, but this is not exactly easy this year!

	    <br /><br />

            Ideally we would ask that you provide lunch for your young people, and if you can raise the money to cover that locally, awesome. We will co-ordinate travel arrangements for the Friday with you, this will include detail of the YP who need to dip into the hardship fund.</p>

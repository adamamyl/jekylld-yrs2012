            <p>Hopefully you've came to this page, because you're interested in YRS, and want to know more.</p>

            <p>To take part in YRS, you need to have
            <strong>some</strong> knowledge of code, or spreadsheets,
            or some graphics skills. Don't worry if they're not too
            good, or if you've only been hacking for a couple of
            months. You'll learn more during YRS week. And have the
            support from others in the same boat as you &#8212; <strong>you
            are not alone</strong>.

            <p>We'll be updating this page with questions/answers, as
            well as some more info, soon.</p>

            <p>To take part in YRS, we need some information from you.
            Please fill out the form below, and in a few days or so,
            you'll be hearing from Lawrence (on the phone).</p>

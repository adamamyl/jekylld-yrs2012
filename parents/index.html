            <p>Young Rewired State is free for your child. It runs from the 6 &rarr; 11<sup>th</sup> August and we will aim to find a local centre for your child. If no local centre can be found, we will offer to mentor them remotely and they will be invited to come to the festival of code, and to the show and tell on the Saturday.

            <br /><br />

            We will be in touch with your child directly to send them information about the event, the centre that they have been allocated to and some resources for them to brush up their skills or acquire some basics.

            <br /><br />

            Each centre will be different, some will provide lunches and some will not &#8212; you will get detailed information about these practical things from the centre itself in June.

            <br /><br />

            You will be expected to cover the costs for getting your child to and from the centre each day.</p>

            <h3>The Friday and Saturday festival</h3>

            <p>This year all of the young people who take part in YRS are invited to spend the Friday night at <a href="http://www.tnmoc.org">the National Museum of Computing (TNMOC)</a> in the grounds of <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/">Bletchley Park</a>. They will be sleeping in tents and coding, practising their presentations and so on &#8212; as well as all meeting each other and having a brilliant time.

            <br /><br />

            Each centre will organise the travel to Bletchley and will go with the young people and will continue to work with them during the 24 hours they are there. If your child is being mentored remotely, the mentor will organise this with you.

            <br /><br />

            There will be a huge show and tell on the Saturday in the grounds of TNMOC to a selection of Press, Government, Industry, Sponsors and people who want to support them &#8212; you are all welcome. There is no pre-requisite for the Saturday show and tell kids to have been at the camp over the night before, they can just come to The National Museum of Computing  on the Saturday morning for the afternoon presentations.</p>

            <p>Young Rewired State is free for your child. It runs from the 6 &rarr; 12<sup>th</sup> August and we will aim to find a local centre for your child. If no local centre can be found, we will offer to mentor them remotely and they will be invited to come to the festival of code, and to the show and tell on the Saturday.

            <br /><br />

            We will be in touch with your child directly to send them information about the event, the centre that they have been allocated to and some resources for them to brush up their skills or acquire some basics.

            <br /><br />

            Each centre will be different, some will provide lunches and some will not &#8212; you will get detailed information about these practical things from the centre itself in June.

            <br /><br />

            You will be expected to cover the costs for getting your child to and from the centre each day.</p>

            <h3>The Friday and Saturday festival</h3>

            <p>This year all of the young people who take part in YRS are invited to spend the Friday (and Saturday) night at the festival of code. They will be sleeping on the floor and coding, practising their presentations and so on &#8212; as well as all meeting each other and having a brilliant time.

            <br /><br />

            Each centre will organise the travel to the festival site and will go with the young people and will continue to work with them during the 24 hours they are there. If your child is being mentored remotely, the mentor will organise this with you.

            <br /><br />

            There will be a huge show and tell on the Saturday to a selection of press, government, industry, sponsors and people who want to support them &#8212; you are all welcome. There is no pre-requisite for the Saturday show and tell kids to have been at the camp over the night before, they can just come on the Saturday morning for the presentations.</p>

            <p>This year we have asked for a number of parents from previous years to act as points of contact for all of you &#8212; for any questions you may want to ask a parent who has had a child attend Young Rewired State before. The contact details for these parents will be shared with you through your child (once they have registered) but in the first instance, please <a href="mailto:angijlong@gmail.com"> contact "Angi Long"</a>.

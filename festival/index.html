        <p>Friday 10th to Sunday 12th sees the grand final of the Young Rewired State 2012 week. On the Friday night the young programmers will all come to the Custard Factory in Birmingham and have fireside chats whilst they code with wonderful people who are programmers doing great things, including representatives from Raspberry Pi, London Zoo and twilio amongst many others. Whilst they finish coding their apps and preparing their presentations they will be able to hear, chat and interact with some of the UK's greatest digital visionaries.</p>

<p>Experienced designer dnd developer said; "Programming taught me that I can make
things, that I can change the world around me, and that my imagination truly is the only limit. That's
why events like Festival of Code are so important. Programming is the new literacy and initiatives
like the Festival of Code are essential catalysts in inspiring and empowering the Shakespeares of
tomorrow".</p>
